website = Website('https://yle.fi')

# Step 1: Create your prompts
system_prompt = "you are a language teacher"
user_prompt = f"Find all finnish verbs in the text and give me their list together with their translation into English - {website.text}"

# Step 2: Make the messages list
messages = [
    {"role":"system","content":system_prompt},
    {"role":"user","content":user_prompt}           
] 

# Step 3: Call OpenAI
def list_of_verbs(url):
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model = "gpt-4o-mini",
        messages = messages
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Step 4: print the result
print(list_of_verbs('https://yle.fi'))

# next steps
# create a method that takes in
# 	just one url 
# 	a language into which the translation should be done
# 		test websites in different languages, it is able to recognise finnish no problem
# 	"verbs" could also be a variable and could be replace with other word classes, maybe even strings? - it is supposed to be a vocab builder
# use all parametres to create the prompts
# next step could be to oprionally override the model
# revamp the output to show the languages as a header
